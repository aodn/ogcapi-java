# OGC API Java Server

This module contains the real implementation of the OGC API interface generated by the other modules. The packages is
organized in the following way:

Each package is going to implement one OGC function set, for example tile pages implemented the OGC tile api. And there
are some problems with the generated interface and can be handled in the following ways:

## Conflict RESTful api

For example /collections is defined in common, feature, tile, if you implement these interface then the spring cannot 
started due to conflict endpoints.

A custom configuration is created CustomMvcRegistrations.java to intercept the endpoint creations so that if the 
method is marked with @Hidden, it will be ignored in both swagger document and endpoint creation. Hence mark 
the @Hidden if you see conflict and leave 1 method that needed, or mark all as @Hidden and manually craft on
if required.

## Unmapped Enum in @PathValue and @ParamValue

By default, Spring used the converter which will not convert Enum correctly if the Enum is not name exactly the same 
as the enum definition, for example ABC("abc") will not convert correctly if your string is abc, instead of ABC.

A CustomWebMvcConfigurer.java is created so that additional formatter is added to handle Enum convert.

## The core package

This is the place to store most logic on querying the Search engine. You can define your own Search and if the system
found another Search, the default ElasticSearch will not be provisioned.

### Common Query Language (CQL) parser

We use the geotools' CQl parser and extend it so that it generated the needed Elastic Search Query, please read
CQLToElasticFilterFactory.java
