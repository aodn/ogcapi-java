        "label": "University of Groningen",
        "definition": "The University of Groningen has a long academic tradition extending back to 1614, which makes Groningen the oldest university in the Netherlands after Leiden. Many very talented people in a variety of disciplines have studied or worked at the university during the 390 years of its existence, including a Nobel Prize winner, the first female University student in the Netherlands and the first female lecturer, the first Dutch astronaut and the first president of the European Bank. They share their academic roots with more than 200,000 other people who have attended the University of Groningen as students, lecturers or research workers. The young University of Groningen was already an outstanding example of an international community in the seventeenth century. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first Rector Magnificus, Ubbo Emmius, was German, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region. The founding of the university – at that time still a college of higher education – was an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine and Philosophy. The first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the university with about 100 students enrolling every year. The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by ‘Bommen Berend’ in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period. Petrus Camper, though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient’s clinic for surgical medicine. Opportunities and threats followed on each other’s heels during the nineteenth century. In 1815, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant. In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG). Teaching now took place in Dutch as well as in Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty. This laid the foundations for the present research university. The University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 21,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.",

PANGAEA® aims at collecting, scrutinising, and disseminating geo-referenced data about natural and anthropogenic components and functions in ecosystems at scales ranging from individual organisms, mesoscale features (e.g. upwelling, eddies, seamounts, coral reefs), and oceanic basin to global planetary scales. Core services supplied by PANGAEA® are scientific data management, long-term data archiving, data publication, and data dissemination via visualisation and analysis software and via interoperability with other European and international data dissemination systems. Data management includes quality control of metadata and the development of ontologies and vocabularies according to international protocols and standards. PANGAEA® has further defined work flows and technologies to allow automatic ingestion of data from marine observatories based on OGC standards ( (SWE - Sensor Web Enablement). Metadata are extensive and each dataset is citable and accessible by Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Datasets published by PANGAEA® are extremely diverse and include for example water column profiles, sediment core profiles, biogeographic distributions, meteorological and oceanographic time series, vital rate measurements on individual organisms or communities, sea bed photographs, audio and video records, and ROV surveys. PANGAEA® integrates biological data on plankton (including viruses, bacteria, autotrophic and heterotophic protists, crustaceans and jellyfish), fish, corals, micro-, meio- and macrobenthos, marine mammals and birds. In addition to contemporary observations we offer an extensive paleobiogeographic record from marine sediment cores. Biological data include key biodiversity parameters such as taxon-specific abundance and biomass, and also an extensive range of parameters describing the life history and vital rates of marine life. PANGAEA® is accredited as a World Data Centre by the International Council for Sciences (ICSU) World Data System (WDS) and accredited as World Radiation Monitoring Centre (WRMC) by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) as part of their WMO Information System.

Biodiversity.aq is recognised as an official SCAR Product and integrates SCAR-MarBIN (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research - Marine Biodiversity Information Network), with the biodiversity databases managed by the Australian Antarctic Division, bringing together data from marine and terrestrial realms. biodiversity.aq is the data management tool and repository for the biodiversity-related research conducted at the Princess Elisabeth Station. Biodiversity.aq will use the best available technology to integrate, share and disseminate all available information on Antarctic Biodiversity. Its implementation by the Belgian Biodiversity Platform ascertains that biodiversity.aq can take advantage of the relevant experience of the Belgian GBIF node. biodiversity.aq is steered by an International Steering Committee composed of selected experts in the field of Polar biodiversity.",
