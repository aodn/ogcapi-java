    "statement" : "National Reference Stations: A mooring has been deployed with sensors for conductivity, temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fluorescence and measurement of turbidity at two depths - near surface and near sea bed. At the seafloor, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) has been deployed. Reference stations telemeter a reduced data set via Iridium satellite or nextG for real time monitoring. Physical sampling is undertaken at each of the reference stations on a monthly or quarterly basis. The physical samples are analysed for nutrients, plankton species, both visibly and genetically, and pCO2. Biological sampling will greatly improve Australia's capability to meet its obligations for ecosystem based management and allow many researchers the opportunity to investigate possible long term changes in ecology that are likely to be linked to climate variability and wide scale validation of remotely sensed (satellite) observations of plant biomass.",
