The third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.

The buoy has an Inductive Modem (IM) line that extends from the buoy to the bottom and then along the bottom for around 50 m and then rises to flotation located 9 m below the surface. Instruments are located on this riser to give a profile through the water column. The station is designed to measure temperature of the water column at the front of the reef and in particular to detect upwelling and other events where warmer bottom water is pushed across the shelf onto the reefs. This not only indicates processes operating across the shelf but also conditions when coral bleaching may be more common. The buoy was decommissioned in July 2017.",

This resulted in a data gap between the cyclone in February 2011 and the buoy being deployed in December 2011. It is antcipated that the AIMS weather station will be restored in late 2012 in which case the above water sensors will transition back to the AIMS tower with the in-water sensors remaining as part of the IMOS funded work.
