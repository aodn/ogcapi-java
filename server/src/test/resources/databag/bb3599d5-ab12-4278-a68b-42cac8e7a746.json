  "title" : "Northern Australia Automated Marine Weather and Oceanographic Stations",
  "description" : "Automatic weather stations have been deployed by AIMS since 1980. Most of the stations are along the Great Barrier Reef including the Torres Strait in North-Eastern Australia but there is also a station in Darwin and one in Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. Many of the stations are located on the reef itself either on poles located in the reef lagoon or on tourist pontoons or other structures. The following is a list of the weather stations which have been deployed by AIMS and the period of time for which data may be available. Records may not be continuous for the time spans given.\n\n                    Currently Active Stations:\n\n\n                    Queensland:\n                    Agincourt Reef: Start 1/11/1989\n                    Cape Bowling Green: Start 9/7/1983\n                    Cleveland Bay: Start 3/7/1990\n                    Davies Reef: Start 18/10/1991\n                    Square Rocks: Start 19/12/2009\n                    Hardy Reef: Start 14/6/1989\n                    Lizard Island: Start 13/08/2010\n                    Heron Island: Start 02/08/2008\n                    Myrmidon Reef: Start 2/11/1987\n                    Wreck of the Yongala: Start 30/10/2010\n\n\n                    Northern Territory:\n                    Darwin: Start 14/02/2015\n\n\n                    Western Australia:\n                    Ningaloo Reef (Milyering): Start 12/2/1997\n\n\n                    Torres Strait:\n                    Thursday Island: Start 06/02/12\n                    Bramble Cay (Maizab Kaur): Start 15/7/2015\n                    Masig (Yorke) Island: Start 6/2/2012\n\n\n                    Historical Data:\n                    Badu Island: Start 08/05/2018: End 03/06/2021\n                    Beagle Gulf Mooring: Start 24/5/2015: End 16/7/2017\n                    Cape Cleveland: Start 2/6/1993: End 30/9/1996\n                    Cape Ferguson: Start 1/11/1983: End 30/5/1985\n                    Coconut Island: Start 30/9/1988: End 5/11/1991 (Data not yet located)\n                    Coral Creek (Hinchinbrook Island): Start 16/10/1980: End 30/7/1985\n                    Daintree River: Start 12/2/97: End 31/5/98\n                    Halftide Rock: Start 26/7/2000: End 19/12/2009\n                    John Brewer Reef: Start 31/7/1987: End 30/5/1988\n                    One Tree Island: Start 18/11/2008: End 11/06/2021\n                    Orpheus Island: Start 20/12/2002: End 02/09/2010\n                    Raine Island: Start 08/08/2012: End - Station currently maintained by Qld National Parks\n                    Rib Reef: Start 29/2/1980: End 3/12/1985\n                    Saibai Island: Start 01/05/2016: End 05/03/2021\n\n\n                    Weather stations may be equipped with sensors to measure some or all of the following parameters: sea temperature at a range of depths, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation (light as PAR), wind direction and wind speed.\n\n\n                    These data are collected to support scientific research at AIMS. A number of funding bodies have contributed to the infrastructure and data collection, or continue to contribute to and support the program.
