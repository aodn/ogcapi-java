  "description": "This data collection consists of observations at the sea surface made by the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) mooring, including meteorological parameters, downwelling radiation, and sea water temperature and salinity. Hourly averages of each parameter are delivered in near real-time. SOFS is an observing platform in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, approximately 350 nautical miles south-west of Tasmania. It obtains frequent measurements of the surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of heat, moisture, energy and CO2 between the atmosphere and the upper ocean to improve understanding of climate and carbon processes. The mooring was first deployed at (46.7S, 142E) in March 2010.",
